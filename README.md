## Dependencies

On the basis of `Python >= 3.9` environment, install the necessary dependencies by running the following command:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Inference Example
Example of how to use the `s3bir encoder`. Make sure you have downloaded the [model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AdxC8h-XD9Rf29_vFUnHZ5r933INMN3r/view?usp=drive_link) before running the script.

When working with images, the forward pass must receive the argument `dtype='image'`, and for sketches, use `dtype='sketch'`.

```shell
python3 s3bir_encoder.py
```
